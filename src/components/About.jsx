                Away from my computer, I love to follow sports - hockey, football, basketball, and soccer. Growing up in New England,
                I also like to get outside and go hiking or paddleboarding. Other things I do in my free time are watch movies or TV
                shows, produce music, work out, and try to get better at cooking.
